## **How It Works**  

| Function | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `extract_linkedin_domain(url)` | Extracts the LinkedIn domain from a given URL. |
| `extract_links_and_save_to_csv(driver, filename, domain)` | Scrapes LinkedIn profile links and saves them in a CSV file. |
| `auto_more(driver, filename, domain)` | Clicks the "More results" button until no more profiles load. |
| `is_captcha_present(driver)` | Checks if a CAPTCHA is present on LinkedIn. |
| `login_linkedin(username, password, driver)` | Logs into LinkedIn and handles CAPTCHA manually if required. |
| `extract(link, t)` | Extracts Name, Company, Location, and Premium Status from a profile page. |
| **Main Script** | Orchestrates the full process, stops after extracting 100 profiles or when no links remain. |

## **File Structure**  
```
linkedin-user-extractor/
â”‚â”€â”€ extracted_links.csv  # Stores extracted profile links
â”‚â”€â”€ linkedin_final.csv   # Stores extracted user data
â”‚â”€â”€ your_script.py       # Main Python script
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md            # Project documentation
```

---

## **Error Handling**  
- If CAPTCHA is detected, the script prompts manual resolution.  
- If **LinkedIn blocks access**, you may need to use a new account.  
- If extraction fails for a profile, the script skips it and continues.
